    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Evaluate the terms of a continued fraction.

<section class="intro">

A **generalized continued fraction** has the form

<!-- <equation class="equation" label="eq:continued_fraction" align="center" raw="x = b_0 + \frac{a_1}{b_1+\frac{a_2}{b_2+\frac{a_3}{b_3+\frac{a_4}{b_4+\ldots}}}}" alt="Continued fraction"> -->

```math

```

<!-- <div class="equation" align="center" data-raw-text="x = b_0 + \frac{a_1}{b_1+\frac{a_2}{b_2+\frac{a_3}{b_3+\frac{a_4}{b_4+\ldots}}}}" data-equation="eq:continued_fraction">

If `a_i = 1` for all `i`, the above expression reduces to a **simple continued fraction**.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
iterContinuedFraction = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-iter-utils-continued-fraction@v0.2.1-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var iterContinuedFraction = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/math-iter-utils-continued-fraction/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-iter-utils-continued-fraction@v0.2.1-umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.iterContinuedFraction;
})();
</script>
```

#### iterContinuedFraction( iterator\[, options] )

Evaluates the terms of a continued fraction.

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array-to-iterator' );

var arr = array2iterator( [ 3, 4, 12, 4 ] );

var v = iterContinuedFraction( arr );
// returns ~3.245
```

The function supports the following `options`:

-   **iter**: maximum number of iterations. Default: `1e308`.
-   **tol**: tolerance at which to terminate further evaluation of the continued fraction. Default: [floating-point epsilon][@stdlib/constants/float64/eps].

To explicitly cap the maximum number of iterations, set the `iter` option.

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array-to-iterator' );

var arr = array2iterator( [ 3, 4, 12, 4 ] );

var opts = {
    'iter': 2
};
var v = iterContinuedFraction( arr, opts );
// returns 3.25
```

The function terminates continued fraction evaluation once the difference between continued fraction approximations is sufficiently small. The default tolerance is [floating-point epsilon][@stdlib/constants/float64/eps] (`~2.22e-16`). Once an update to a continued fraction approximation is less than or equal to this tolerance, the function terminates evaluation. To adjust the tolerance (e.g., to return a rough approximation), set the `tol` option.

```javascript
var iterContinuedFractionSeq = require( '@stdlib/math-iter-sequences-continued-fraction' );

var opts = {
    'tol': 1.0e-7
};
var it = iterContinuedFractionSeq( 3.141592653589793, opts );
// returns <Object>

var v = iterContinuedFraction( it );
// returns ~3.14159292
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If an iterated value is non-numeric (including `NaN`), the function returns `NaN`. If non-numeric iterated values are possible, you are advised to provide an [`iterator`][mdn-iterator-protocol] which type checks and handles non-numeric values accordingly.
